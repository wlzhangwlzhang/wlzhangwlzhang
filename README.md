- 👋 Hi, I’m @wlzhangwlzhang
- 👀 I’m interested in plasma physics, including accelerator, laser-driven ion acceleration, leptonic beam collision, strong-field driven quantum electrodynamics (QED).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make some physical experiments at home.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making interesting and profound science discoveries.
- 📫 How to reach me: Email: wlzhang.physics@gmail.com
